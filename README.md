# Analysis and classification of electroencephalographic motor imagery signals through deep learning methods

This project was developed as part of my M.Eng. thesis at the University of West Attica and focuses on the classification of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals during motor imagery tasks using Deep Learning techniques. The aim is to contribute to brain-computer interface (BCI) systems that can enable neuroprosthetic applications for individuals with mobility impairments.

Three deep learning architectures were implemented and evaluated:
- **Feedforward Neural Network (FFN)**
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network**
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**

Using data from BCI Competition IV ‚Äì Dataset 1, the project investigates the performance of these models in classifying raw EEG signals with minimal preprocessing. The **CNN model** achieved the highest accuracy, reaching up to **90% on test data**, outperforming the other models in capturing spatiotemporal dependencies in the signals.

## üß† Project Overview

The system classifies EEG signals recorded during motor imagery (MI) tasks using data from **BCI Competition IV ‚Äì Dataset 1**. The focus was on analyzing models that can be used in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), with potential applications in neuroprosthetics.

### Objectives:
- Preprocess raw EEG signals with bandpass filters
- Segment data and apply trial-based classification
- Train and evaluate:
  - A shallow **CNN**
  - A **LSTM** model
  - A **Feedforward Neural Network (FFN)**
